for the people that use this
thanks i am very happy that you chose this software.
as i am typing this, i still haven't given this a name, so yay i guess?

how this works is that you right click the folder and open a terminal at this folder. do a google check on how you do this bc idk how to explain it now that there are so many versions of operating systems. you will also have to have the dotnet thingy from microsoft downloaded. then you type dotnet run.
but hopefully i can have this as an executable so that you dont have to do this...
